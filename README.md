# üß† Enhanced Face Detection System

A powerful real-time face detection system using OpenCV that supports both Haar Cascade and DNN (Deep Neural Network) based detection. It includes FPS tracking, UI overlay, pause/resume controls, and smoothed face count for a stable experience.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ **Real-time Face Detection**
- üîÅ **Switch between Haar Cascade and DNN detection**
- üßÆ **Smoothed FPS & Face Count**
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Pause/Resume Detection**
- üéØ **Overlay UI for performance metrics**
- üì∑ **Camera Resolution & FPS Configuration**
- üîÅ **Live Frame Mirroring (Selfie-like view)**

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- NumPy

You also need the following DNN model files (optional but recommended for better accuracy):

- `opencv_face_detector_uint8.pb`
- `opencv_face_detector.pbtxt`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If DNN files are not found, it will automatically fall back to Haar Cascade.
